# ACM-W Manipal Official Website
Welcome to the ACMW Manipal Official Website repository! This project is part of the "Women in Open Source" event organized by ACMW Manipal during Tech Week. The goal of this event is to enhance the ACMW Manipal website by adding essential features and improving its functionality. 

## Contribution Ideas 
Organizers will create specific issues within this repository representing different tasks and features to be implemented. Participants are encouraged to choose an issue they are interested in working on and submit their solutions accordingly. Here's how to get started:
- Explore Issues: Navigate to the [Issues](https://github.com/ACMW-Manipal/acmw-website-24/issues) tab of this repository to view a list of available tasks.
- Choose an Issue: Review the descriptions and requirements of each issue. Select one that aligns with your skills and interests.
- Assign Yourself: Once you've chosen an issue, comment on it to indicate your intent to work on it, and we'll assign you the issue.
- Work on the Solution
- Submit a Pull Request: Submit a pull request (PR) from your branch to the main repository's branch that corresponds to the issue.
Reference the issue number in your PR description (e.g., "Fixes #1") to link the PR to the issue.
- Collaborate and Review: Engage in discussions with maintainers and reviewers. Make any necessary adjustments based on feedback.
- Merge and Close: Once your PR is approved, the organizer will merge it into the main branch. The corresponding issue will be closed.
